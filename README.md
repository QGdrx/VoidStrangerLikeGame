A little project I did to familiarise myself with the game engine Godot so that I could make bigger games in my free time. It's a first attempt that I'm pretty happy with :D.

I tried to make a game similar to Void Stranger, a game I'm a big fan of. The game was made on Godot and is very short, it was just a test to see what I could code quickly. 

Some of the sprites were made by Aymen Bou Ali here's his Instagram if you ever want to get in touch with him : https://www.instagram.com/bilil__i?igsh=dDlkdmh2M204dGRr
